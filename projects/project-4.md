    <br />In my first semester as a Grad student, everyone was assigned in groups of four to five to complete this project. We were provided a context prompt that involves a furniture store. The business would retain a database containing information on customers, products sold, shipping, employees, and delivery trucks. Before we could write any SQL Query, we had to understand the logical workflow in the furniture outlet's business process. We created various diagrams to document our studies. Some of them include Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and Data Dictionary. <br /><br /></span>

  <span style="color: black">
    <br />I worked with everyone to discern which nouns from the provided prompt should be considered as Entities. This would identify what would be stored as tables and what their corresponding attributes or traits. Writing the SQL Queries to build the Database was one of the last parts. Our documented diagrams would facilitate group discussions on how we would proceed after finalizing our decisions. <br /><br /></span>

    <br />From this project, I was given the opportunity to develop my management skills and coordinate with others to deliver the project ontime. In addition, I was able to employ the knowledge of writing SQL Query that I studied in-class throughout the semester to develop the Tables and their columns, insert the row data, and configure constraints that would help maintain consistency across our database.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></span>
