    <br />During Spring 2022, I took a course titled, "Data Science: A Programming Approach". I was already familiar with coding in Python, but I gained firsthand experience in employing that code for various machine learning algorithms. To challenge our knowledge, an individual project was assigned where I applied several supervised learning models torwards the MNIST Fashion Image dataset. The objective was to find the best predictive model that would accurately predict clothes based on their category. The entire project and its documented findings was carried out in Jupyter Notebook. <br /><br /></span>

    <br />I worked with everyone to discern which nouns from the provided prompt should be considered as Entities. This would identify what would be stored as tables and what their corresponding attributes or traits. Writing the SQL Queries to build the Database was one of the last parts. Our documented diagrams would facilitate group discussions on how we would proceed after finalizing our decisions. <br /><br /></span>

    <br />From this project, I was given the opportunity to develop my management skills and coordinate with others to deliver the project ontime. In addition, I was able to employ the knowledge of writing SQL Query that I studied in-class throughout the semester to develop the Tables and their columns, insert the row data, and configure constraints that would help maintain consistency across our database.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></span>
