    <br />During Summer 2022, I was enrolled in the Web & Social Analytics class at University of Texas at Arlington. For the major term project, we analyzed online visitor data from provided data of Google's online merchandise store (Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/overview">Kaggle</a>). As a group of 3, we utilized data science techniques to recommend business insight that would support data driven decisions for Google's business. <br /><br /></span>

    <br />An insightful facet from the preprocessed data looked into geographics for Google Store's online visitors. As displayed above in Fig. 2.1, we discovered that the majority of online visitors originated from the Americas (in both overall quantity and how many converted or contributed towards the Google Store's online revenue). However, the average revenue from conversions indicated that visitors from Africa were spending more than visitors from different continents. Our group recommended for the business analytics to look into this deeper, and investigate what could be done to replicate higher average revenue for other continents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></span>
