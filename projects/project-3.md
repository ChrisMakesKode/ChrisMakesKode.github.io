    <br />During Summer 2022, I was enrolled in the Web & Social Analytics class at University of Texas at Arlington. Everyone was assigned into groups of 3 to 5 members to apply class concepts to dataset samples found on Kaggle. For my group of three, we analyzed visitor data from Google's online merchandise store (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/overview). The project's objective was to uncover business insight that would support data driven decisions for Google's business. <br /><br /></span>

    <br />First, the data needed to be preprocessed or cleaned for efficient analysis. Our team had applied JSON on the 12 initial columns to extract a total of 55 variables. Not every variable was particularly valuable or had meaningful data, so we dropped some variables. Our analysis only covered 36 variables: 35 independent and 1 dependent. <br /><br /></span>

    <br />From this project, I was given the opportunity to develop my management skills and coordinate with others to deliver the project ontime. In addition, I was able to employ the knowledge of writing SQL Query that I studied in-class throughout the semester to develop the Tables and their columns, insert the row data, and configure constraints that would help maintain consistency across our database.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></span>
