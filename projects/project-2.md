This was one of my first at-home projects after completing my undergrad. A Caesar Cipher is a simple security tool that is used to protect password and sensitive information. It encrypts the input contents by encrypting, or changing its values by a set amount based on UNICODE.

In this project, I incorporated my knowledge of JavaFX to provide an interface for efficient usage. In addition, I have created several encryption options that encodes input containing uppercase and lowercase characters differently.

I learned JavaFX for a few projects in INSY-4305 during Fall 2020. Through these assignments, I learned how to design an interface that responds conveniently to user's and how to implement it with my written programs in Java.
