    <br /><br />This was one of my first at-home projects after completing my undergrad. A Caesar Cipher is a simple security tool that is used to protect password and sensitive information. It encrypts the input contents by encrypting, or changing its values by a set amount based on UNICODE.<br /><br /></span>

  <span style="color: black;">
    In this project, I incorporated my knowledge of JavaFX to provide an interface for efficient usage. In addition, I have created several encryption options that encodes input containing uppercase and lowercase characters differently. <br /><br /></span>

  <span style="color: black">
    I learned JavaFX for a few projects in my Advanced Applications Development class during Fall 2020. Through these assignments, I learned how to design an interface that responds conveniently to user's and how to implement it with my written programs in Java. <br /><br /></span>
