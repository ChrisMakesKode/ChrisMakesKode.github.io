    <br />For a Project Management course in Fall 2022, I proficiently demonstrated Project Management concepts for a <i>hypothetical</i> delivery service titled, <i><b>At Your Doorstep</b></i>. Had the delivery service aspect were actually real, <i><b>At Your Doorstep</b></i> would offer businesses to save overhead travel costs and efficient transportation services of goods from their app. For instance, say an executive has a major meeting in 30 minutes, but they realized they had forgotten an important printed report back at their residence. With insufficient time to make a round trip, the executive uses this service to request someone to enter their premises and transport their desired deliverable to their current office.  <br /><br />
    Throughout the semester, the project was presented in numerous audits. Various diagrams were constructed to illustrate project management constructs. Some are visible below.<br /></span>

    <br />From a management perspective, our hypothetical was assumed to possess sufficient expertise with the necessary geotracking technologies required for the delivery service. It was expected that these technologies would run high operating expenses, especially with continuous usage. For these reasons, it felt appropriate to pursue the apportion method with WBS. <br />

    <br />With my selected model, it was time to apply it towards new data outside of the MNIST fashion dataset. I took pictures of several articles of clothes that I owned -- carefully positioning them before formatting them in grayscale to resemble the formatted images from the MNIST dataset. <br /><br />
    <br />My best out-of-sample accuracy score was documented at 40%. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></span>
