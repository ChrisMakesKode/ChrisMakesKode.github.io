    <br />For a Project Management course in Fall 2022, I proficiently demonstrated Project Management concepts for a <i>hypothetical</i> delivery service titled, <i><b>At Your Doorstep</b></i>. Had the delivery service aspect were actually real, <i><b>At Your Doorstep</b></i> would be offered for business employees to save overhead travel costs and efficient transportation services of goods from their app. For instance, say an executive has a major meeting in 30 minutes, but they realized they had forgotten an important printed report back at their residence. With insufficient time to make a round trip, the executive uses this service to request someone to enter their premises and transport their desired deliverable to their current office.  <br /><br /></span>

    <br />In determining the optimal model, 4 categories were considered in my analysis:<br />
    - Wall (Clock) Time. The relative speed for a model to fit the data. <br />
    - Accuracy. This indicates how proficient a predictive model accurately predicts the out-of-sample data.<br />
    - Precision. Ratio of the true positives to the sum of true and false positives. <br />
    - Recall. Ratio of the true positives to the sum of the true positives and the false negatives. <br />
    <br />
    <br />Five models, or algorithms were considered:<br />
    - Linear Regression.<br />
    - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).<br />
    - Naive Bayes. <br />
    - Decision Tree. <br />
    - Random Forest. <br /><br />
    <br />Resultingly, I selected Decision Trees as my best model for its favorable overall efficiency and simplicity. <br />

    <br />With my selected model, it was time to apply it towards new data outside of the MNIST fashion dataset. I took pictures of several articles of clothes that I owned -- carefully positioning them before formatting them in grayscale to resemble the formatted images from the MNIST dataset. <br /><br />
    <br />My best out-of-sample accuracy score was documented at 40%. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></span>
